# Commons â€¢ Snippets

This folder contains reusable code. Everything is written as generic and non-opinionated as possible. However, it probably needs to be adjusted for a projects specific requirements since it's derived from my projects.

## What to find here

[basic-electron](./basic-electron)    
Pretty much the getting started example from Electron, slightly adjusted.

[WIP] [express-role-based-authentication](./express-role-based-authentication)    
Currently working on it. The goal is a reusable middleware for client projects since WordPress and other platforms or frameworks are usually pretty overkill and not flexible enough for custom solutions.
