# Commons â€¢ Setups

This folder contains some setups for build tools (Like Gulp / Webpack) and starting points for specialized requirements (Like Arduino development with Node & Sockets)

## What to find here

[arduino-node-socket](./arduino-node-socket)    
Codebase for fetching the output of arduinos serialport and sending it to a web frontend via socket.io

[Abandoned] [gulp-modular](./gulp-modular)    
Attempt to heavily modularize gulp tasks to tailor it to the project requirements without writing it from scratch

[gulp-react-typescript](./gulp-react-typescript)    
Pretty robust and basic setup to develop a react app with typescript compilation

[gulp-vanilla](./gulp-vanilla)    
One of my first gulp setups that went through many iterations. Has been mainly used in single-page applications with vanilla JavaScript and Sass (indent syntax)

[webpack-express-ws-pug-react](./webpack-express-ws-pug-react)    
What a beast. Very abstracted setup with everything you'd need for a modern webapp. Also the most advanced of the bunch.
